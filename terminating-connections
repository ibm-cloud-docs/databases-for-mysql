## Terminating Connections

If you are on MySQL 9.6 and newer, your admin user has the `pg_signal_backend` role. If you find connections that need to be reset or closed, the admin user can use both [`pg_cancel_backend` and `pg_terminate_backend`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-SIGNAL-TABLE). The `pid` of a process is found from the `pg_stat_activity` table.

- `pg_cancel_backend` cancels a connection's current query without terminating the connection, and without stopping any other queries that it might be running.
  ```sql
  SELECT pg_cancel_backend(pid);
  ```
  {: .codeblock}

- `pg_terminate_backend` stops the entire process and closes the connection. 
  ```sql
  SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid);
  ```
  {: .codeblock}

The admin user does have the power to reset or close the connections for any user on the deployment except superusers. Be careful not to terminate replication connections from the `ibm-replication` user, as it interferes with the high-availability of your deployment.
