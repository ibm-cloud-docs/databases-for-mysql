## Connection Pooling

One way to prevent exceeding the connection limit and ensure that connections from your applications are being handled efficiently is through connection pooling.

Many MySQL driver libraries have connection pooling classes and functions. You need to consult your driver's documentation to implement connection pooling that is optimal for your use case. For example, the Python driver Psycopg2 has [classes to handle connection pooling in your application](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/pool.html). The Java MySQL JDBC driver has methods for [connection pooling at both the application and application server level](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/datasource.html).

Alternatively, you can use a third-party tool such as [PgBouncer](https://pgbouncer.github.io/) to manage your application's connections.
